rUnemploymentData
===

This R Package contains data and visualization functions for USA unemployment data. The data was scraped from the 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in January 2015. The functions which scraped the data are also in this package, 
which allows you to reproduce and verify the dataset yourself.
